<h1><strong>Real-Time Health Data Streaming Pipeline with Kafka and Spark</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Overview</h2>
<h3>This project implements a real-time data streaming pipeline capable of handling data from a system that ingests health metrics such as heart rate and oxygen saturation level from patients' smart watch devices and triggers emergency vehicle dispatch within a certain radius if any health metrics exceed abnormal levels. The data generated mimics real-time APIs that supply this data for analytics.</h3>
